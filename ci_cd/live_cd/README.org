*Note*: The Live CD local build is only tested under an Ubuntu virtual machine.

* Overview

The live CD is based on [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian GNU/Linux]] and aims to provide a convenient way to run =Entrusted=.
- It's not always that easy for many to install [[https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/getting-started/installation][Podman]] (Operating System or User specific issues)
- You may not want to run Docker or Podman directly on your main machine
- A live system running in a virtual machine might be more convenient overall
  
** Recommended settings

*You need at least 1G of RAM* for the Live CD to run correctly:
- There's a correlation between allocated memory and free disk space
- At least ~700MB of free space need to be available for temporary storage between conversions ("conversion sandbox" creation)

By default, the live CD allocates =75%= of the assigned RAM as free disk space.
- The default boot parameters are appended to the grub settings =ramdisk-size=75% overlay-size=75%=.
- The above mentioned values can be changed on startup, when the boot loader menu is showing (=TAB= key)

** User journey

- Download the live CD ISO image from the [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/releases][GitHub releases page]]
- Boot the live CD ISO from the virtualization solution of your choice ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]], [[https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html][VmWare]], etc.)
- Convert your documents via the =entrusted= online service (Web Interface): =http://ip_of_vm:13000=
  
** Build steps

The steps below have been tested on [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]] 11 (/bullseye/) and [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] 22.04 (/jammy/).
- Clone the =entrusted= git repository from GitHub
- Run the =build.sh= script in this directory: =chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh=
- The resulting ISO image will be available at =$ROOT_PROJECT_FOLDER/artifacts=

  The Live CD ISO image size is roughly =800 MB=.
  
* General Information

** Users

There are 2 users in the system:
- The super user =root= with the password =root=
- A regular user =entrusted= with the password =entrusted=
  
** Services

On top of default regular processes, the following key services run on boot ([[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/][systemd]]):
- SSH is running on the default =22= port
- The =entrusted-webserver= service is running on port =13000=
- Custom firewall rules (=iptables=) restrict network access to SSH and the =entrusted-webserver=
  - The command =entrusted-fw-disable= allows all network traffic
  - The command =entrusted-fw-enable= restores default firewall rules

You'll need to ensure that you've got access to access the Web Interface (port 13000) and SSH (port 22). Depending your virtualization software and its networking settings, you may need to map or forward port =13000= and =22=.
  
* Entrusted Web UI access

** Web UI screenshot

By default, the /Entrusted Online Service/ runs on port =13000= and binds to all network interfaces (=0.0.0.0=).

You can access it from your machine =http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_VIRTUAL_MACHINE:13000=.

Please *replace* =IP_ADDRESS_OF_VIRTUAL_MACHINE= with a valid IP address or hostname, based on your network settings.

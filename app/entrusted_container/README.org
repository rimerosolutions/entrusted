#+TITLE: entrusted/app/entrusted_container

* What is this?

This module provides the document sanitization logic running inside a "sandbox" ([[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/][Podman]] or [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]]).

- There's a small series of transformations leading to the generation of a trusted PDF document (optionally with full-text search support, if [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition][OCR]] was requested)
- There is no command-line invocation of external programs within the container

* What is required?

This module is deployed as a container image (/Docker/ or /Podman/ or /Lima/), published on [[https://hub.docker.com/r/uycyjnzgntrn/entrusted_container][Docker Hub]].

* How to build this?

Because of a shared library, you /MUST/ build the container image from the =entrusted/app= root folder.

On Mac OS, there are potential compilation issues with the MuPDF library.

#+begin_src sh
  env MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15 RUSTFLAGS="-lc++ -Ctarget-feature=+crt-static" cargo build
#+end_src

** Podman

#+begin_src sh
  podman build -t docker.io/uycyjnzgntrn/entrusted_container:0.3.2 . -f entrusted_container/Dockerfile
#+end_src

** Docker

#+begin_src sh
  docker build -t docker.io/uycyjnzgntrn/entrusted_container:0.3.2 . -f entrusted_container/Dockerfile
#+end_src

* How to publish to Docker Hub?

The commands below apply to =Podman=, the syntax might different a bit for =Docker= or =Lima=.
- For all the commands to follow, it is assumed that you're at the root of the =entrusted= project folder
- A multi-arch container image is published (=linux/amd64= and =linux/arm64= platforms)

#+begin_src sh
  ./ci_cd/create_container_image.sh

  podman login -u uycyjnzgntrn docker.io

  podman manifest push --all --format docker --sign-by GPG_KEY_ID_HERE  docker.io/uycyjnzgntrn/entrusted_container:0.3.2  docker.io/uycyjnzgntrn/entrusted_container:0.3.2

  podman logout docker.io
#+end_src

* How to run this?

This application is not meant to be run directly.
- It is leveraged by the =entrusted-client= program (shell commands to =Podman= or =Docker= or =Lima=)
- Maybe this will run directly via native Operating Systems sandbox capabilities in the future

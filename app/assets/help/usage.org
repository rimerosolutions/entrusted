This tool is relatively simple to provide clear use-cases, avoid UX complexity and maintenance burden.

* Basic usage
You start by upload files from your computer to add documents to process.
By default, output files will be saved in PDF format with the suffix "-entrusted", in the same folder as the uploaded file (configurable).

* Advanced usage
It's possible to customize output settings while uploading files (e.g., passwords for decrypting documents, output folder).
- There's still a dilemma between providing full flexibility for each uploaded file vs. having global default settings.
- The overall vision is to not provide 10,000 options that only 1% of users will either understand or find beneficial

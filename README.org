#+TITLE: README

**This program is under rewrite for usability, coding practices and maintainability.**

* What is this?

** Overview

=Entrusted= is a document sanitizer tool that converts "/potentially suspicious files/" into /safe PDFs/:
- This is achieved by removing active content inside a "lightweight sandbox" ([[https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/containerization][containerization]])
- Please note that this tool doesn't provide absolute security guarantees

Unless you use the [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/tree/main/ci_cd/live_cd][live CD]], you *MUST* install either [[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/getting-started/][Podman]] prior launching the program. *On Mac OS*, you need more specifically [[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][Docker Desktop]].

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InEsPLyFsKQ][Youtube presentation]] and [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/files/9892585/entrusted_document_sanitizer.pdf][PDF slides]] about =Entrusted=.

** Features

Key features include the following:
- Files are processed inside a "sandbox" (disabled internet connectivity)
- The application is multilingual (English and French translations for now)
- Password-protected files are supported (known Office document formats and PDF files)
- The sanitization of huge documents is frictionless
- Optionally, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition][OCR]] can be applied to PDF results (selectable and searchable text)
- Files can be converted in batch (sequentially)
- PDF result quality is configurable (processing speed v.s. better looking output)
- A Web server with a user interface is available and can act as an "online service"
- The [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/tree/main/ci_cd/live_cd][live CD]] provides both enhanced security and configuration convenience

** Use-cases

Do you identify yourself in one of the situations below?
- I suspect that my computer might have been infected few times after opening documents
- I "acquire" documents from file sharing applications or the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web][Dark Web]]
- I often need to open email attachments from unfamiliar senders
- I download files from "potentially non-trusted websites"

** Supported files

The following file types can be processed with =Entrusted=:
- PDF files (=.pdf=)
- Text Documents (=.rtf=, =.doc=, =.docx=, =.odt=)
- Presentations (=.ppt=, =.pptx=, =.odp=)
- Spreadsheets (=.xls=, =.xlsx=, =.ods=)
- Images (=.jpg=, =.jpeg=, =.gif=, =.png=, =.tif=, =.tiff=)
- OpenDocument Drawing Document Format (=.odg=)
    
* What is available?

** User interfaces

There are three user interfaces ([[./app/entrusted_client][Desktop and Command-Line]], [[./app/entrusted_webserver][Web]]):
- The graphical Desktop interface is recommended for most users
- If you prefer the Web interface, please download the live CD for an out-of-the-box user experience:
  - You can run the live CD with tools such as [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v][Hyper-V]], [[https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/workstation-player.html][VmWare]], [[https://www.parallels.com/][Parallels]], etc.
  - The Web interface can be accessed at the address =http://localhost:13000=
  - Replace =localhost= by the IP address of your virtual machine in the above-mentioned link
  - You [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/wiki/Live-CD-%E2%80%90-Port-Mapping-%E2%80%90-User-Interface-Access][might need to map or forward]] port =13000= depending on your virtualization solution network settings.

** Downloads

Please visit the [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/releases][releases page]] for downloads (64-bit: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64][amd64/x86_64]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64][aarch64/arm64]]).
- =aarch64= (i.e., =arm64=) builds are not yet available for Windows
- For Linux, when in doubt, pick the =glibc= file, unless you're sure about your system
  - You cannot expect a binary built with [[https://musl.libc.org/][musl libc]] to run with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/][gnu libc]] (unless statically linked)
  - Most of Linux distributions use =glibc= as C implementation library ([[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]], [[https://fedoraproject.org/][Fedora]], etc.) 
  - [[https://www.alpinelinux.org/][Alpine Linux]] uses =musl=. Some distributions provide a =musl= flavor ([[https://voidlinux.org/][Void Linux]], [[https://www.gentoo.org/][Gentoo]], etc.)  
- Ignore any warnings about trusting the application under Windows or Mac OS, the binaries are not signed
  - [[https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac][Notes for Mac OS]]
  - Notes for Windows: Click "Ignore" or "Run", if you get a warning dialog.

* What is required?

It is assumed that you can allocate at least 1 GB of memory for document processing.
- Operating System: Linux, Mac OS or Windows
- Container Runtime: [[https://podman.io/][Podman]] (Linux) or [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] (Linux, Mac OS, Windows). On Mac OS, you need more specifically [[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][Docker Desktop]].

Conversions will fail if the container solution is not running or available in your [[https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html]["PATH settings"]]:
  - The tool doesn't attempt to modify software on your machine (install or change programs)
  - The tool doesn't attempt to manage software on your machine (start or stop services)

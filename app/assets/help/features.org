Below is a non-exhaustive list of the main features.

* Supported document formats
Entrusted supports the following document formats:
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- Text Documents (.docx, .doc, .odt, .rtf)
- Presentations (.pptx, .ppt, .odp)
- Ebooks (.epub, .mobi, .cbz, .fb2)
- Spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xls)
- Images (.png, .jpg, .gif, .bmp)

* Sandboxing
Entrusted tries leveraging existing sandbox solutions whenever possible, by just fitting into existing infrastructure.
- On Linux, a Flatpak package is provided
- On Windows, an MSIX package is available
- On Mac OS, rules of the App Sandbox apply

The best solution for security and maintenance would be a live CD (meant to run on a virtual machine). Sadly, that approach lowers adoption for non-technical users.

Earlier versions of Entrusted achieved sandboxing using Podman or Docker container solutions (third-party extra software that users would install first). An ISO image (Live CD) was also available.

* Password-protected documents

** Decrypting files
Password-protected documents are supported for PDF files and known Office formats. While uploading files, you can supply a password to decrypt the selected file.

** Encrypting the PDF output
While upload files, you can provide a password to encrypt the output for the selected file (AES-256 encryption).

** Notes about encryption
- On Windows, Microsoft Edge sometimes struggles with password-protected PDF files. Pick another browser or a decent PDF reader instead.
- The encryption scope of this tool is limited to setting passwords on the PDF output.
- There are many well-established solutions for advanced encryption (age encryption, GPG, OpenSSL, etc.)
